  <p> I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:
    <blockquote>Passing cars, <br> When you can see,<br> May get you
    ,<br> A glimpse,<br> Of eternity.</blockquote>
    I definitely won't be passing any cars

  <p> My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything <br> packed and ready to go.
    Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>cellphone</li>
      <li>iPod</li>
      <li>digital camera</li>
      <li>protein bar</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Just the essentials.</p>
    <p> As Lao Tzu would have said <q>A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway</q> </p>
