  <h1 id="segwayTitle"> Segway'n USA</h1>
  <p> Documenting my trip around the US on my very own Segway! </p>
  <h2> August 20, 2005 </h2>

  <p> Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through some interesting places on the way: <br> Walla Walla, WA, Magic City,
    ID, Bountiful, UT, Last Chance, CO, Why, AZ and Truth or Consequences, NM. </p>
  <h2>July 14, 2005</h2>
  <p> I saw some Burma Shace style signs on the side of the road today:
    <blockquote>Passing cars, <br> When you can see,<br> May get you
    ,<br> A glimpse,<br> Of eternity.</blockquote>
    I definitely won't be passing any cars

  <p> My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything <br> packed and ready to go.
    Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me: <br>cellphone, iPod, digital camera and a protein bar.
    Just the essentials.<br> As Lao Tzu would have said <q>A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway</q> </p>
