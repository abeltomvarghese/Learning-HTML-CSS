  <h1> Welcome to myPod </h1>
  <p> Welcome to the place to show off your iPod, whereever
    you might be. Wanna join the fun? All you need is any iPod from the
    early classic iPod to the latest ipod Nano, the smallest iPod Shuffle
    to the largest iPod Photo, and a digitial camera. Just take a snapshot
    of your iPod in your favorite location and we'll be glad to post it on myPod.
    So, what are you waiting for? </p>
